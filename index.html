			<h2>ABOUT</h2>
			<p>Hi my name is Tiger Ye and I am currently an undergraduate student studying Mechatronics Engineering at the University of Waterloo. I love to combine my interests of CAD and programming to make unique and interesting creations.</p>
			<p>I've always been infatuated with the idea of making small gadgets at a young age. I am currently working towards learning the basics of circuit design to compliment my CAD and programming skills and fulfill my childhood dream.</p>

		<h2>SKILLS</h2>
		<p><b>Languages:</b> C++, Java, Python, Javascript, CSS, HTML</p>
		<p><b>CAD:</b> Solidworks, Inventor, Fusion 360, AutoCAD, TinkerCAD</p>
		<p><b>Other:</b> Microsoft Office, Cura, GrabCAD Print, GrabCAD Workbench, Photoshop</p>

		<h2>WHAT I BRING</h2>
		<p>
			<b>Perseverance</b> - Getting the job done is not always easy, I know this from personal experience. Whether it was running cross country or working to finish a long arduous project I have learned to push myself to cross the finish line no matter the task.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Leadership</b> - Working as the Design and Overall lead for Agincourtâ€™s FRC robotics team I was pushed into a leadership role in the team. This was the first time I led a major project and eventually I learned to become the leader the team needed.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Curiosity</b> - I love to tinker with things whether it is physical or virtual and learn how they work. One of these things is the website you are on right now! I have always been curious about how web-development works so I took a few weeks to learn the basics of Javascript, CSS and HTML through online resources and made this website.

		<h2>EXPERIENCE</h2>

			<div class="text_right">
			<h3>FRC - First Robotics Competition</h3>
			<p>FRC has taught me a variety of hands on skills such as using drill presses, band saws, milling machines and much, much more. FRC has also let me apply the skills I learned in the classroom to physical products.</p>
			<p>My role in the 1246 FRC team was overall/design lead and thus I was responsible for inetgrating CAD models into the final design, providing task for members of the team and designing the elevator, powercell (balls) storage system and th hooking mechanism for the climb.</p>
			<p>Probably one of my proudest achievements was using Fusion 360 to design a mechanical single use hook for Team 1246 FRC robot. A single use hook was needed to ensure the elevator would not descend during power off period at end of game. The mechanism utilizes spare parts found workshop and a custom milled aluminum hook. A spring was used such that no electrical components were required to latch on to the elevator.</p>

			<h3>Toronto Pan Am Sports Centre Maintenance Worker</h3>
			<p>Over the summer of 2017 I was a maintenance worker for the Toronto Pan Am Sports Center. During my time there I helped helped out with general maintenance duties. I don't really have pictures of myself working there so here's a picture of the center instead.</p>
			<p>Some days I would work with senior workers and go to the roof of the Pan Am Sports Centre to inspect it to look for leaks and possible damages. Other days I would help out with spreading woodchips around the south-end trees. One time I even helped them excavate the ground to search for a broken wire that prevented one of the lamps from turning on.</p>

		<h2>PROJECTS</h2>
		<div class="container extra_padding project">
			<div class="text_left hover_link">
			<h3>Computer Mouse Body</h3>
			<p>Used Solidworks form tools to design an original sleek and ergonomic computer mouse body to be 3D printed. Constraints included designing around a circuit board from a seperate mouse and designing for 3D printability. The final result is the mouse I use to this day! Check out the CAD files <a href="https://grabcad.com/library/computer-mouse-85" target="_blank">here</a>!</p>

			<h3>Conveyor Assembly</h3>
			<p>Used Solidworks and imported CAD models from McMaster-Carr to create a large modular conveyor assembly with sorting abilities. The conveyor was designed with the specifications of needing to transport 20x20x20cm and 10x10x30cm boxes with a max weight of 8.48kg. Check out the CAD files <a href="https://grabcad.com/library/modular-conveyor-system-with-sorting-1" target="_blank">here</a>!</p>

			<h3>Goose Escape Game</h3>
			<p>Used C++ and BearlibTerminal to program an turnbased endless roguelike dungeon game with randomly generated walls and enemies. The deeper you go the more enemies and walls you spawn you'll collect bird feed along the way which allow you to pause all enemy movement. How deep can you go before you are overwelmed by enemies? Check out the C++ code <a href="https://github.com/tigerqye/Goose-Escape" target="_blank">here</a>!</p>

		<h2>INTERESTS</h2>
		<p>Heres justs some random facts about me.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>I'm 1.9m, that's pretty tall! I could reach stuff thats pretty high up, could be pretty useful during a job.</li>
			<li>I like to play chess. Just an amatuer but its fun nonetheless typically I just stick to tactics though.</li>
			<li>I play ultimate frisbee and like to run long distance. I even made it to OFSAA once for cross country running! Unfortunately I can not say the same for my basketball skills.</li>
			<li>If you couldnt tell from some of my projects I love to 3d print! I have an Ender 3 Pro at home and love to think of new and interesting things to design and print.</li>
