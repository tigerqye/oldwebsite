			<h1>ABOUT</h1>
			<p>
				Hi my name is Tiger Ye and I am currently an undergraduate student studying Mechatronics Engineering at the University of Waterloo. I currently love to combine my interests of CAD and programming to make unique and interesting creations.
			</p>
			<p>
				I've always been infatuated with the idea of making small gadgets at a young age. I am currently working towards learning the basics of circuit design to compliment my CAD and programming skills and fulfill my childhood dream.

			<h1>EXPERIENCE</h1>
			<p>
				<b>Perseverance</b> - Getting the job done is not always easy, I know this from personal experience. Whether it was running cross country or working to finish a long arduous project I have learned to push myself to cross the finish line no matter the task.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Leadership</b> - Working as the Design and Overall lead for Agincourtâ€™s FRC robotics team I was pushed into a leadership role in the team. This was the first time I led a major project and eventually I learned to become the leader the team needed.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Curiosity</b> - I love to tinker with things whether it is physical or virtual and learn how they work. One of these things is the website you are on right now! I have always been curious about how web-development works so I took a few weeks to learn the basics of Javascript, CSS and HTML through online resources and made this website.

		<h1>PROJECTS</h1>
		<div class="container project_box">
			<h1>Computer Mouse Design</h1>
			<p> Used Solidworks form tools to design an original sleek and ergonomic computer mouse shell to be 3D printed. Constraints included designing around a circuit board from a seperate mouse and designing for 3D printability. More details can be found <a href="https://grabcad.com/library/computer-mouse-85" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="container project_box">
			<h1>Conveyor CAD</h1>
			<p> Used Solidworks and imported CAD models from McMaster-Carr to create a large modular conveyor assembly with sorting abilities. The conveyor was designed with the specifications of needing to transport 20x20x20cm and 10x10x30cm boxes with a max weight of 8.48kg. More details can be found <a href="https://grabcad.com/library/modular-conveyor-system-with-sorting-1" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="container project_box">
			<h1>Canada Airport</h1>
			<p> Designed an airport program that read airplane flights from a textfile and displayed departure and arrival flights to Toronto. More details can be found <a href="https://github.com/tigerqye/Canada-Airport" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="container project_box">
			<h1>Turntable</h1>
			<p> Used CAD knowlegde to design a turntable in Fusion 360 and printed it out using a 3D printer. Model was designed around integrating metal spheres from a children's toy. More details can be found <a href="https://grabcad.com/library/turntable-26" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
